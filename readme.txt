3. **🛠 What to build next?**
If you're at the early stage and want to make it real:
- Use **Solidity** to draft the token contract (ERC20 or ERC777).
- Include a **“DonationHandler”** contract to process the special donation splits.
- Add **EnergyLedger.sol** to manage redistribution of energy credits.

4. **🚀 Private Dev Roadmap (Idea):**
Create a `docs/roadmap.md` with milestones like:
- Token Contract ✅
- Smart Contract Audit ⏳
- Website + Token Dashboard ⏳
- Community Airdrop Plan ⏳
- Temple Prototype Blueprint ⏳
